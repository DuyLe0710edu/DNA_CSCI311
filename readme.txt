# DNA Sequence Alignment Program

This program allows you to perform DNA sequence alignment using three different algorithms:
- Longest Common Substring
- Longest Common Subsequence (LCS)
- Edit Distance

## Files:
1. `GUI.py`: The main GUI for interacting with the program. you need to 'brew install python-tk' to use that 
2. `file_handler.py`: Handles reading and parsing FASTA files.
3. `algorithms.py`: Contains the placeholders for the three sequence alignment algorithms.

## Prerequisites:
- Python 3.x
- Tkinter library (usually comes with Python by default)

## Instructions:

1. Ensure all files are in the same directory.
2. Implement your algorithms in `algorithms.py` where the placeholders are.
3. Run the program using the command: "python3 GUI.py"
